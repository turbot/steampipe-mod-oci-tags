# OCI Tags Mod

Run tagging controls across all your OCI compartments to look for untagged resources, missing tags, resources with too many tags, and more.

## References

[OCI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/home.htm) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, and codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration.

## Documentation

- **[Benchmarks and controls â†’](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/oci_tags/controls)**

## Getting started

### Installation

1) Install the OCI plugin:
```shell
steampipe plugin install oci
```

2) Clone this repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-oci-tags.git
cd steampipe-mod-oci-tags
```

### Usage

#### Running benchmarks

Preview running all benchmarks:
```shell
steampipe check all --dry-run
```

Run all benchmarks:
```shell
steampipe check all
```

Use Steampipe introspection to view all current benchmarks:
```shell
steampipe query "select resource_name, title, description from steampipe_benchmark;"
```

Run an individual benchmark:
```shell
steampipe check benchmark.untagged
```

#### Running controls

Use Steampipe introspection to view all current controls:
```shell
steampipe query "select resource_name, title, description from steampipe_control;"
```

Run a specific control:
```shell
steampipe check control.compute_virtual_machine_untagged
```

### Credentials

This mod uses the credentials configured in the [Steampipe OCI plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/oci).

### Configuration

Several benchmarks have [input variables](https://steampipe.io/docs/using-steampipe/mod-variables) that can be configured to better match your environment and requirements. Each variable has a default defined in `steampipe.spvars`, but these can be overriden in several ways:

- Modify the `steampipe.spvars` file
- Remove or comment out the value in `steampipe.spvars`, after which Steampipe will prompt you for a value when running a query or check
- Pass in a value on the command line:
  ```shell
  steampipe check benchmark.mandatory --var 'mandatory_tags=["Application", "Environment", "Department", "Owner"]'
  ```
- Set an environment variable:
  ```shell
  SP_VAR_mandatory_tags='["Application", "Environment", "Department", "Owner"]' steampipe check control.compute_virtual_machine_mandatory
  ```
  - Note: When using environment variables, if the variable is defined in `steampipe.spvars` or passed in through the command line, either of those will take precedence over the environment variable value. For more information on variable definition precedence, please see the link below.

These are only some of the ways you can set variables. For a full list, please see [Passing Input Variables](https://steampipe.io/docs/using-steampipe/mod-variables#passing-input-variables).
